The federal government shutdown in the United States reached its 15th day on October 15, 2025, with no resolution in sight as partisan gridlock continues in Congress[web:41][web:45]. Over 750,000 federal employees remain furloughed, and essential services such as law enforcement and air traffic control are operating without pay[web:41].

Key agencies including the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control have had operations curtailed or suspended[web:40]. The deadlock stems from disagreements over federal spending, healthcare subsidies, and proposed budget cuts[web:45].

President Donald Trump has publicly stated that military personnel should receive pay on schedule, but broader services and programs remain unfunded[web:41]. House Speaker Mike Johnson warned this could become the longest shutdown in history unless healthcare demands are dropped[web:43].

Public institutions, including all Smithsonian museums and the National Zoo, have closed; layoffs have affected thousands of federal workers, especially in health and environmental agencies[web:40][web:45]. Congress has repeatedly failed to pass proposals, and observers note the impact may grow as the stalemate persists[web:41][web:40].
